Gwei.cz is an agnostic collective of [individuals](#members) from various crypto, decentralization and peer-to-peer communities in and around Czechia. The group assembled in 2020 as online community focused on Ethereum and has been active since.

Our goal is to bring active builders together to support each other and coordinate how to drive local adoption, educate newcomers, and raise awareness of the benefits of decentralized technologies and open-source software.

## Basic Rules

1. All members are equal.
1. No governance (or leadership).
1. No official communication channels (like Twitter).
1. To become a new member you must be an active builder (_Proof of Work_) and be invited by a current member.
1. A majority of members may decide to remove a member.
1. All members are listed on the website where everyone has the opportunity to list their projects.

## Code of Conduct

1. It’s impossible to change other people. We can only change ourselves.
1. We take ownership for our thoughts, beliefs, words, and actions.
1. We don’t spread rumors.
1. We don’t talk behind someone’s back.
1. We resolve disagreements one-on-one and don’t drag other people into the problem.
1. We don’t blame problems on others. When we feel like blaming, we take it as an invitation to reflect on how we might be part of the problem (and the solution).
1. We focus on strengths more than weaknesses, on opportunities more than problems.
1. We bring our whole selves to the group, valuing authenticity, emotional expression, and the diverse perspectives that come from being fully human.
1. We empower each other to make decisions and take actions without needing approval, trusting in everyone’s capability and judgment.
1. We see mistakes and failures as opportunities for learning and growth, and we continuously seek to improve ourselves and our processes.
1. We commit to openness and honesty in all our communications, sharing information freely and proactively.
1. We make and keep commitments with integrity, recognizing that our reliability is crucial for mutual trust and effective collaboration.

### Conflict Resolution Process

- In the first phase, the two people sit together and try to sort it out privately.
- If they can’t find a solution agreeable to both, they nominate a member they both trust to act as a mediator. The mediator doesn’t impose a decision. Rather he or she supports the participants in coming to their own solution.
- If mediation fails, a panel of topic-relevant members is convened. Again the panel does not impose a solution.
- If resolution is not found, the other members they both trust might be called into the panel to add to the panel’s moral weight (but again, not to impose a solution).

## FAQ

### What guarantees the neutrality of Gwei.cz?

The current Gwei.cz is just a loosely-coupled group of many different individuals (and their projects) where neutrality is guaranteed mainly through our basic rules, such as zero governance or the absence of official channels.

### What happened with the old Gwei.cz?

All previous internal Gwei.cz activities such as Twitter, Matrix, Forum and [other services](https://status.gwei.cz/) are being gradually phased out as [Gwei.cz Legacy](https://legacy.gwei.cz).

### How to become a member?
